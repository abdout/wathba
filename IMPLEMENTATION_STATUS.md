## 🚀 How to Continue Development

### 1. Frontend Integration (Next Task)
The frontend needs to be connected to the new APIs. Update:
- `/lib/features/product/productSlice.js` - Fetch from API instead of dummy data
- `/components/ShopPage.jsx` - Use API pagination
- `/components/ProductDetails.jsx` - Load from `/api/products/[id]`

### 2. Test the Application
```bash
# Visit these URLs to see real data:
http://localhost:3004/         # Homepage
http://localhost:3004/shop     # Shop with real products
http://localhost:3004/cart     # Cart (requires login)
```

### 3. Continue Implementation
Follow the plan in `plan.md` for remaining phases:
- Phase 2: Order Management
- Phase 3: Vendor Dashboard Backend
- Phase 4: Admin Panel Backend
- Phase 5: Payment Integration

## 🐛 Known Issues & TODOs

### Minor Issues
- Store model uses 'username' instead of 'slug' (schema difference)
- Rating model uses 'rating' instead of 'value' (fixed in APIs)
- Warning about deprecated package.json#prisma config (can be ignored)

### TODOs
- [ ] Add authentication middleware to protected routes
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add input validation with Zod
- [ ] Set up error handling middleware
- [ ] Add API documentation

## 💡 Tips for Next Developer Session

1. **Database is Live** - Be careful with destructive operations
2. **APIs are Ready** - Focus on frontend integration
3. **Test with Postman** - Import the API collection for testing
4. **Check Logs** - Server logs show all API calls
