## 📝 Notes

- The frontend is well-architected and mostly complete
- The project's main bottleneck is the complete absence of backend
- Database schema is excellent and ready to use
- Once APIs are created, frontend integration should be straightforward
- Consider using Supabase or Firebase for faster backend setup
