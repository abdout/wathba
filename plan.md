## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### Strengths
- **Excellent frontend architecture** with proper component structure
- **Complete database schema** ready for implementation
- **Full internationalization** already working
- **ImageKit and Clerk** properly configured
- **Redux state management** well-structured

### Actually Completed
- **✅ Core backend API layer** - 26 endpoints operational
- **✅ Payment processing** - Stripe checkout/webhook integrated
- **✅ Email service** - Resend with order confirmation template
- **✅ Data persistence** - PostgreSQL with Prisma working
- **✅ Production config** - Security headers, rate limiting, error handling

### Still Needed
- **❌ Background jobs** - No Inngest integration
- **❌ Reviews system** - APIs not implemented
- **❌ Testing suite** - No tests written
- **❌ Documentation** - No API docs or user guides
- **🟡 Search features** - Basic search works, no recommendations

### Recommendations
1. **Focus on backend first** - Frontend is mostly ready
2. **Use Server Actions** or **tRPC** for type-safe APIs
3. **Implement incremental features** - Start with core e-commerce
4. **Add monitoring early** - Sentry from the beginning
5. **Test payment flows thoroughly** - Critical for business

### Risk Areas
- Payment integration complexity
- Multi-vendor order splitting logic
- Real-time inventory management
- Subscription billing implementation
- Performance with large product catalogs
